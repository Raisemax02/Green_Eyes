# :feelsgood: SOSLANG - Sos Programming Language :feelsgood:
This is a simple interpreter for a programming language called SOS. The SOS language is designed to be easy to read and write and is meant for simple scripting tasks. It was born as a challenge between me and a friend.

Prerequisites :exclamation:
The interpreter requires Python 3 to be installed on your system, and the following libraries: os and subprocess.
 
# Getting Started :beer: 
To get started, you can simply download the sos_interpreter.py file and run it using Python 3. The interpreter can be used either interactively or by specifying a .sos file to execute.

# Usage :space_invader: 
To start the interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:

# Copy code 
python sos_interpreter.py

This will start the interpreter in interactive mode, where you can enter commands one at a time. Alternatively, when the program starts, you can specify an .sos file

# Language Features :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
The SOS language provides the following features:

Variables: variables can be created and assigned values using the Sos keyword, e.g. Sos x = 10

Printing: the sos keyword can be used to print the value of a variable, e.g. sos x

System Commands: the soo keyword can be used to execute system commands, e.g. soo ls -l
